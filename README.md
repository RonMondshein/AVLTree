# AVL Tree Implementation and Experimental Analysis

This repository showcases the implementation and performance evaluation of an AVL Tree-based list.

## Overview

The project is divided into two main parts:
1. **Practical Implementation:** A Python-based implementation of an AVL Tree-based list, supporting typical list operations like insertion, deletion, search, and more.
2. **Theoretical and Experimental Analysis:** Performance evaluation of AVL trees in comparison to linked lists and arrays, based on various operations like:
   - Insertion at the beginning, end, or random positions.
   - Deletion and rebalancing analysis.
   - Sorting and permutation operations.

## Key Features

- **AVL Tree Implementation:**
  - Supports operations such as `insert`, `delete`, `retrieve`, `sort`, `concat`, and `permutation`.
  - Maintains balance for efficient operations with worst-case time complexity of O(log n).
  
- **Performance Analysis:**
  - Compares the performance of AVL trees, linked lists, and arrays under various scenarios.
  - Includes analysis of rebalancing operations and their costs.
